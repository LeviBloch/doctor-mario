        <h1>About Dr. Mary.io</h1>
        <p>
            Dr. Mary.io is a sleek(ish), modern, multiplayer, high-speed block-matching puzzle game inspired by Nintendo's Dr. Mario.
            I'm developing this while stuck at home during the 2020 pandemic, so this probably won't be maintained much once life resumes to normal.
            I was way too lazy to add any serious ways of stopping bots/hacking, so please just be good people and remember that the game is only fun when you play honestly.
            By the way, this project is open source! Either that, or I forgot to set it to private on GitHub ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
            Check it out <a href="https://github.com/LeviBloch/doctor-mario">here.</a>
